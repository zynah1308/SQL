In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables about customers and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers c
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales f
ON c.order_id=f.orderid;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT DISTINCT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER by price ASC
LIMIT 1
;
#OR

SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)* price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(quantity)AS Quantity,Product, SUM(quantity*price)AS Revenue, Location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101" 
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), AVG(price*quantity) 
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE feb.quantity>2;
